#### Domain 1

# Security and Risk Management

##### **Overview**:

_The first CISSP domain focuses on the fundamentals of security and how to asses/manage risk._

_This domain also focuses heavily on the key factors of governance and compliance, and how security helps by being aligned and contributing to each._

## Understand, adhere to, and promote professional ethics

### ISC2 Code of Professional Ethics

It is important that the Preamble and the Code of Professional Ethics Canons be understood fully in the context of corporate and industry applications, and the Canons should be memorized and adhered to in the order presented

###### ISC2 Code of Ethics Preamble

- The safety and welfare of society and the common good, duty to our principals, and to each other, requires that we adhere, and be seen to adhere, to the highest ethical standards of behavior
- Therefore, strict adherence to this Code is a condition of certification

###### **Wording and order of the ISC2 Code Of Ethics Canons**

1. Protect society, the common good, necessary public trust and confidence, and the infrastructure
2. Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally
3. Provide diligent and competent service to principals
4. Advance and protect the profession

###### How to apply Canons in various scenarios and contexts

The items should be memorized as presented. If there is a conflict in the Canons - they need to be applied in order.

### Organizational Code of Ethics

######Core Concepts

- Ethics are based on doing nothing that is harmful to anyone else

- For organizations to have consistent ethics, they must be codified in corporate laws/policies

## Understand and apply security concepts

######Core Concepts:

- Security must support the business in achieving its goals and objectives
- Security must increase the value of the organization

In summary, the focus of the security function is to:

1. Allow and enable the organization to achieve it's goals/objectives
2. Increase the organization's value

### Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Authenticitiy, and Nonrepudiation

######Core Concepts:

###### **<u>Five Pillars of Information Security</u>**

- Confidentiality: protects and prevents unauthorized disclosure
- Integrity: Protects and adds value to assets by making them more accurate, more timely, more current, more meaningful
- Availability: Ensures organizational assets are available when required by stakeholders
- Authenticity: Proves the source and origin of important valuable assets (proof of origin)
- Nonrepudiation: Provides assurance that someone cannot deny having done something

## Evaluate, apply, and sustance security goevernance principles

### Alignment of the Security Function to Business Strategy, Goals, Mission, and Objectives

- The goal of governance is to enhance organizational value
- Corporate governance is based upon the goals and objectives of the organization
- Security must be managed top down instead of bottom up
- Scoping and tailoring are used to align security objectives with organizational goals and objectives
- Security governance must be aligned with corporate governance

Security needs to enable the organization's values and objectives, not just information information processes or fix technical issues.

###### Aligning security governance with corporate governance

Security governance is best aligned with corporate governance when it draws on the knowledge and experience of senior and upper management, HR, Legal, IT, and key functional areas of the organization

###### Scoping and tailoring

Scoping: Looks at potential control elements and determines which ones are in scope and which ones are out of scope.

Tailoring: Looks specifically at applicable - in scope - security control elements and further refines or enchances them so they're most effective and aligned with goals and objectives.

### Organizational Processes

Security needs to be an integral part of all organization processes.

###### Accountability versus Responsibility

######Core Concepts:

| ACCOUNTABILITY                                             | RESPONSIBILITY                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Only **one** person or group or entity must be accountable | **Multiple** people can be responsible |
| Can never be delegated                                     | Can be delegated                       |
| Where the buck stops                                       | The doer                               |
| Ultimate ownership and liability                           | In charge of a task or process         |
| Sets rules and policies                                    | Develops plans and implements controls |

###### Who is ultimately accountable for security?

- Board and CEO

### Organizational Roles and Responsibilities

######Core Concepts

- The role of security is to be an enabler
- The owner/controller is the person that created, bought, or is most familiar with an asset
- The processor is the person, function, or group responsible for data and who do things on behalf of the controller

Custodians are basically repsonsible for an assset which they may not necessarily be the owners of

###### Who is specifically responsible for security? Everyone

- Everyone has some degree of responsibility for security in their role. However asset owners are accountable for telling people what their responsibilities are. Asset owners are in the best position to know the value of the assets they ontrol, and can best determine how much security is needed to protect those assets


### <u>Due Care vs Due Diligence</u>

######Core Concepts:

- Due care is the responsibile protection assets
- Due diligence is the ability to prove due care

| DUE CARE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | DUE DILIGENCE                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accountable protection of assets based on and aligned with goals and objectives of the organization                                                                                                                                                        | Ability to prove due care to stakeholders--upper management, regulators, customers, shareholders, etc |
| This definition aligns what security should be doing with what the organization should be doing. It aligns accountable protection of assets based on the goals and objectives of the organization. This is what due care means from a security perspective | Due diligence is what is done to prove due care on a regular basis to organization stakeholders       |

###### Definitions of due care and due dilgence:

Consider penetration testing as an example:

- Due care would be the owner of a system requesting that a penetration test be performed
- Due diligence would be then providing proof that vulnerabilities were addressed in a cost-effective and efficient way to mgmt and stakeholders.

## Understand legal, regulatory, and compliance issues that pertain to information in a holistic security context

### Cybercrimes and Data Breaches

_Bottom line: Don't be the low-hanging fruit that can be easily picked!_

### Licensing and IP Requirements

######Core Concepts

- The goal of intellectual property laws is to encourage the creation of intellectual goods (inventions, literary and artistic works, designs, symbols, and names) AND to protect the same

###### What do trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks protect?

|                  | PROTECTS                                                                        | DISCLOSURE REQ'D | TERMS OF PROTECTION  | PROTECTS AGAINST                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **TRADE SECRET** | Business information                                                            | **NO**           | Potentially infinite | Misappropriation                       |
| **PATENT**       | Functional innovations, Novel idea/inventions                                   | **YES**          | Set period of time   | Making, using, or selling an invention |
| **COPYRIGHT**    | Expression of an idea embodied in a fixed medium (books, movies, songs, etc)    | **YES**          | Set period of time   | Copying or substantially similar work  |
| **TRADEMARK**    | Color, sound, symbol, etc. used to distinguish one product/company from another | **YES**          | Potentially infinite | Creating confusion                     |

### Import/Export Controls

- Country based rules and laws implemented to manage which products, tech, and info can move in/out of those countries

###### The Wassenaar Arrangement

Encryption is a powerful technological tool, but can pose a significant threat if it gets in the wrong hands. Cryptography is heavily used in the context of military and government agnecies.

The Wassenaar Arrangement was put in place to manage the risk that cryptography poses, while still facilitating trade. It allows certain countries to exchange and use cryptography systems of any strength, while also preventing the acquisition of those items by terrorists.

Participating members can exchange cryptography of any strength, but countries are not a member are excluded from data exchange.

###### International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)

A US regulation that was built to ensure control over any export of items like missiles, rockets, bombs, munitions

###### Export Administration Regulations (EAR)

EAR focuses on commercial-use related items like computers, lasers, marine items, and more. It can also include items that may have been designed for commercial use but actially have military applications.

### Transborder Data Flow

######Core Concepts:

- Transborder data flow laws restrict the transfer of data across country borders
- When sharing data across borders, applicable laws must be considered
- Enforcement of requirement in one country may not apply to other countries
- GDPR

### Issues related to Privacy

######Core Concepts

- **Privacy is the state or condition of being free from being observed or disturved by other people**
- Personal data is information on its own or in combination that uniquely identifies an individual
- PII
- To have privacy, you need security

###### Personal data

Data that can be used on its own or in combination to identify an individual

Personal data can be referred to as:

- PI - Personal information
- PII - Personally Identifiable Information
- SPI - Sensitive Personal Information
- PHI - Protected Health Information

**Direct identifiers:**

- information that relates specifically to an individual: name, address, ID

**Indirect identifiers:**

- information that cannot be used on it's own to uniquely ID an individual

###### Privacy Requirements

######Core Concepts:

- Supervisory authorities are independent authorities in each EU state that investigate privacy complaints
- GDPR principles, OECD priniples, Role of supervisory authority


###### Privacy Assessments

######Core Concepts:

- Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is a process undertaken on behalf of an organization to determine if poersonal data is being protected appropriately and to minimize risks to personal data when appropriate

###### What is a PIA/DPIA?

Process undertaken on behalf of an organization to determine if personal data is being protected appropriately

Why is this important?

1. Identify/evaluate risks related to privacy breaches
2. Identify what controls should be applied to mitigate privacy risks
3. Offer organizational compliance to privacy legislations

### Contractual, Legal, and Industry Standards and Regulatory Requirements

######Core Concepts

- Controls should align with compliance requirements
- Legal, privacy, and audit/compliance functions are usually the best sources to determine compliance requirements

## Understand requirements for investigation types (ie admin, criminal, civil, regulatory, etc)


## Develop, document, and implement security policies, procedures, standards, baselines, and guidelines

######Core Concepts

- **Policies** = corporate laws
- Policies document and communicate management's goals and objectives
- Overarching security policy must come from upper management (tone from the top)
- **Procedures** = Step-by-step instructions
- **Standards** = Specific information related to solutions
- **Baselines** = Defined minimal implementation levels
- **Guidelines** = Recommendations or suggestions


## Identify, analyze, and prioritize business continuity (BC) requirements

## Contribute to and enforce personnel security policies and procedures

######Core Concepts

- Hiring, onboarding, and terminating employees
- Employment controls and associated cost-effectiveness


###### Enforce Personnel Security Controls

######Core Concepts:

- Enforce organizational personnel policies and controls for contractors/vendorse
- Contracts, agreements, and NDAs are tools that can be used to enforce personnel security controls
- Attestation and audit are tools that can monitor and show compliance with personnel security controls

## Understand and apply Risk Management concepts

### Risk Management

######Core Concepts:

- Risk management is the identification, assessment, and prioritization of risks and the economical application of resurces to minimize, monitor, and control the probability and/or impact of these risks
- Risk management steps: value, risk, and treatment

1. #### Value

   - The first step is identifying the asssets of the organization and ranking those assets from most/least vulnerable
     - **Quantitative** value analysis
     - **Qualitative** value analysis

2. #### Risk Analysis

   - Determine the risks associated with each asset

     - Four key components that must be identified

       1. **Threat**
          - Any potential danger to an asset

       2. **Vulnerability**
          - Any weakness that exists that could be exploited

       3. **Impact**
          - The extent to which an asset would be negatively affected

       4. **Probability/Likelihood**
          - The chance that a risk might materialize due to a given threat or vulnerability being present

3. #### Treatment

   - Once identified, risks must be dealt with (treated), and there are four treatment methods
     1. **Avoid**
        - Dont do whatever the risky thing is
     2. **Transfer**
        - Purchase an insurance policy
     3. **Mitigate**
        - Implement controls to reduce the risk
     4. **Accept**
        - The owner of an asset accepts a certain level of risk

### Asset Valuation

Core concepts:

- before risks can be identified and managed, valuable assets of the organization must first be identified

| Qualitative Analysis                                                                                                       | Quantitative Analysis                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Does not attempt to assign monetary value                                                                                  | Assigns objective monetary values                              |
| - Relative ranking system based on professional judgement<br />- Uses words like "low, medium, high, 1-5" to express value | Fully quantitative process when all elements are quantified    |
| Qualitative analysis is relatively simple and efficient                                                                    | Purely quantitative is difficult to achieve and time consuming |

### Risk Analysis

- process of identifying threats and vulnerabilities related to an asset
- identify risks and understand probability/impact of risk occurring

#### Threats and Vulnerabilities

Three main components to a risk being present:

- Asset: anything of value to the organization
- Threat: any potential danger
- Vulnerability: a weakness that exists

### Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) Calculation

######Core Concepts:

- ALE = SLE (AV x EF) x AR)

- Asset Value (AV)
  - cost of an asset in monetary value
- Exposure Factor (EF)
  - Measured as a percentage and expresses how much of the asset's value stands to be lost in case of a risk materializing
- Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)
  - Denotes how much it will cost if the risk occurs once
- Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
  - Denotes how many times each year the risk is expected to occur
- Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)
  - Expresses the annual cost of the risk materializing

### Risk Response/Treatment

######Core Concepts:

- Risk can be managed via four approaches
- Risk can never be entirely eliminated


### Applicable Types of Controls

######Core Concepts:

- A complete control is a combination of of preventative, detective, and corrective controls
- In defense-in-depth (layered security)m a complete control should be implemented at each layer

###### Definitions and examples of the types of controls

- Directive
  - controls direct, confine, or control the actions of subjects to force or encourance compliance with security policies
- Deterrent
  - Discourage violation of security policies.
- Preventive
  - can prevent undesired actions or events
- Detective
  - designed to identify if a risk has occurred
- Corrective
  - used to minimize the negative impact of a risk occurring--minimizing the damage
- Recovery
  - deisgned to recover a system or process and return to normal operation following an incident
- Compensating
  - typically deployed in conjuction with other controls to aid in enforcement and support of the other controls

### Categories of Controls

######Core Concepts:

- Safeguards = proactive - before the fact
- Countermeasures = reactive - after the fact
- Categories of controls : admin, physical, and logical/technical

### Functional and Assurance

######Core Concepts:

A good security control should always include two aspects:

- **Functional** = control must do what it is designed to do
- **Assurance** = control can be evaluated to confirm working correctly - provides proof/confidence

### Selecting Controls

######Core Concepts:

- Selected controls must support organizational goals and objectives
- Selected controls must be cost-effective


### Risk Management Frameworks

######Core Concepts:

- Risk management frameworks provide comprehensive guidance and structuring and conducting risk management

###### NIST SP 800-37 RMF

- This guide describes the risk management framework and provides guidelines for applying the RMF to information systems and organizations

###### ISO 31000

- A family of standards relating to risk management
- The scope of ISO 31000 is to provide best practice structure and guidance to all organizations concerned with risk management

###### COSO

- provides a definition to essential entrerprise risk management components, reviews ERM principles and concepts, and provides direction and guidance for enterprise risk management

###### ISACA Risk IT Framework

- contains guidelines and practices for risk optimization, security, and business value. The latest version places greater emphasis on cybersecurity and aligns with the latest version of COBIT

---

###### NIST SP 800-37 Revision 2 (DETAILED)

Understanding the RMF is critical, as it informs and underpins just about every facet of opertaion security governance within an organization

1. **Prepare** to excecute the RMF
2. **Categorize** Information Systems
   - information systems are identified and categorized
   - Purpose: determine any potential adverse impacts to CIA of organizational operations and assets, thereby informing the organizational risk management process
3. **Select** Security Controls
   - After a risk assement has been conducted - select, tailor, and document security controls necessary to protect the information system.
4. **Implement** Security Controls
   - activities at this step are based entirely on the controls selected in step 3 and involves 2 key tasks
     - implementing and selected controls in the security and privacy plans
     - documenting the specific, baselines details of the control implementation
   - The latter task is critical and allows everybody to understand what controls exist and to undertand the controls in the context of the larger operational framework of the organization
5. **Assess** Security Controls
   - Activities during this step help determine if the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and meeting the security and privacy requirements for the system and the organization.
   - Involves formulation of a comprehensive plan that must be reviewed and approved
6. **Authorize** Information System
   - This step requires senior mgmt to decide whether it's acceptable to operate the the system in question, given the potential risk, controls, and residual risk.
7. **Monitor** Security Controls
   - Continuous monitoring of programs allows an organization to maintain the security of an information system over time, adapting to changing threats, vulnerabilities, technologies, and mission proceses.

## Understand and apply threat modeling concepts and methodologies

######Core Concepts:

- threat modeling is used to systematically identify, enumerate, and prioritize threats related to an asset

###### Threat Modeling Methodologies

######Core Concepts:

- Threat modeling is used to systematically identify enumerate, and prioritize threats related to an asset

STRIDE

PASTA

DREAD

###### Social Engineering

######Core Concepts:

- Social Engineering = manipulation of people's actions through intimidation and/or deception
- Social engineering is a prevalent means of attack
- Best way to combat is through awareness/education/training

It's prevalent because it's effective

## Apply supply chain risk management (SCRM) concepts

######Core Concepts

- Risk management methodologies shouldb be aplied to all vendors, suppliers, service providers

### Risks associated with the acquisition of products and services from suppliers and provider

### Risk mitigations

3rd part assements/monitoring

minimum security requirements

Service-level requirements

Silicon root of trust

physically unclonable function

software bill of materials

#### SLR, SLA, and Service Level Reports

######Core Concepts:

- Security must be considered for all acqusitions and must be a part of procurement process
- Security requirements must be clearly communicated (SLAs) to suppliers/vendors/providers
- Security metrics must demonstrate that security controls are operating effectively

###### Service Level Requirements (SLR)

- With the acquisition of a service, additional organizational requirements must be considered, this is done through a document called an SLR, which outliens:
  - Detailed service descriptions
  - Detailed service level targets
  - Mutual responsibilities

###### Service Level Agreement (SLA)

- Service levels (performance levels)
- Governance - the customer and the service provider know who is responsible for what
- Securiy - expected security controls put in place by the service provider that speak to the topic of accountabiltiy and responsibility
- Compliance with all laws and regulations
- Liability/indemnification when any element of the SLA is not met or below threshold

###### Service Level Reports

Issued by a vendor or service provider to a client and provides insight/information about the service provider's ability to deliver services as defined by the SLA. The report may contain:

- Achivement of metrics defined in the SLA

- ID of the issues

- Reporting channels

- Management

- 3rd party SOC reports, which provides idependent verification and assurance that the terms of the SLAs are being met
## Establish and maintain security awareness, education, training program

### Methods and techniques to increase awareness, training, education

######Core Concepts:

- Everyone is responsible for security, however they must know what to do
- The goal of awareness is to change cultural sensitivity to a topic or issue
- Training provides specific skills
- Education provides understanding and decision making capability
