# Security Learning Environment & Homelab
A learning-focused environment for developing cybersecurity and infrastructure skills

### [About Me / Professional Background](about.md)

## üìã Executive Summary
A purpose-built security lab environment where I develop and test cybersecurity skills, with current focus on penetration testing and security infrastructure. This lab serves as both my learning platform and a practical environment for real-world security scenarios.

## üéØ Current Learning Focus
### Certification Preparation
- Active Directory attack methodologies
- Windows domain security testing
- Building practical testing experience in isolated lab environment
- Actively pursuing [PNPT certification](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/)

### Skill Development
- Security testing fundamentals
- Network security concepts
- Infrastructure security and system hardening 

## üî¨ Security Labs & Testing Environments

### [Active Directory Lab](labs/ad-environment.md)
- Dedicated network segment for testing:
    - Windows domain environment for PNPT preparation
    - Kali Linux attack machine, Windows 11/Windows Server
    - Isolated from production services
    - AD attack and defense scenarios

#### [Web Application Security Lab](labs/web-security.md)
- OWASP Juice Shop with Burp Suite and FoxyProxy setup
- Key vulnerability focus:
    - SQL Injection and authentication attacks
    - Data exposure and XXE vulnerabilities
    - Access control and security misconfigurations
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) techniques
- Emphasis on testing methodology and documentation

## üèóÔ∏è Environment Overview

#### [Security Design](infrastructure/security.md)
- Strictly isolated internal network - no external exposure
- Defense-in-depth network segmentation for critical service protection
- Internal PKI using Step-CA for secure certificate management and authentication 

### [Network Segmentation](infrastructure/network.md)

| Network     | Purpose         | Description                                    |
| ----------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Production  | Core Services  | Infrastructure services (Pi-hole, Step-CA, Nginx) |
| Admin       | Management     | Administrative access and management           |
| Testing Lab | Security Testing | Isolated AD lab and security testing resources |

## üñ•Ô∏è [Infrastructure Overview](infrastructure/architecture.md)
My lab is built on an Intel NUC8 Hades Canyon running Proxmox VE 8.2.2, providing a compact yet powerful platform for hosting both infrastructure services and security testing environments. Visit the [detailed architecture page](infrastructure/architecture.md) for complete specifications and design principles.

#### [Core Services](infrastructure/core-services.md)
- Security Infrastructure:
    - DNS security and filtering with Pi-hole
    - Certificate management through Step-CA
    - Secure proxy services with NGINX
- Containerized Environment:
    - Secured Docker deployments
    - Container isolation practices

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
#### Primary Tools
- Proxmox VE for virtualization
- Docker container platform
- Kali Linux for penetration testing suite
- Security tools (Burp Suite, Metasploit, Nmap)
- Network analysis tools and monitoring tools

#### Development Tools
- Bash scripting for security tool automation
- System hardening configurations
- Service deployment and security configurations (NGINX, Docker, PKI)
