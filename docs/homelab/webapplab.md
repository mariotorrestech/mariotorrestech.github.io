# OWASP Juice Shop

To gain a more hands-on understanding of some concepts in CCNP, namely, OWASP vulnerabilities and other technical tools and techniques, I spun up an OWASP juice shop instance within Kali Linux.

This is maintained through OWASP's site under the [Juice Shop section](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/) - and is used for _insecure_ web application concepts.


!!! note "Overview"

    Attack an insecure web application through various methods outlined below. OWASP provides great resources for learning and documentation on their website.


- OWASP Juice Shop with Burp Suite and FoxyProxy setup
- Key vulnerability focus areas:
    - SQL Injection and authentication attacks
    - Data exposure and XXE vulnerabilities
    - Access control and security misconfigurations
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) techniques
- Emphasis on testing methodology and documentation
- Hands-on experience with baremetal hypervisor (Proxmox) and provisioning of internal/services
