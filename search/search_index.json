On each end, the random is multiplied by the same number, in this example 2. As a result - Alice's number is now 14, bob's is 6. In practice, the number is mathematically complex\n3. At this point, the numbers are mathematically related. Alice's and Bob's systems send the numbers to each other; alice's system sends 14 to bob. bob sends 6 to Alices\n4. At this point, they realte the number they received back to the original random number through a multiplication operation. So, Alice multiples the number she recieved (6) with her original number 7, and bob does the same (14 x 3)\n5.
